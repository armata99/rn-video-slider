peer dependencies. make sure You have installed them correctly. You may also install
`react-native-video`. Check out these links to proceed their installation process:
- [reanimated installation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started#installation)

```sh
yarn add rn-video-slider
```
That will be it.

## Usage

```typescript jsx
import {Dimensions} from "react-native";
import Slider, {SliderRef} from "rn-video-slider";

const ControlSet = () => {

  const sliderRef = React.createRef<SliderRef>();
  //call below function in video progress callback
  //sliderRef.current?.setProgress(0.5);

  const _onSlide = (value: number) => {
    //seek your video with value
  };
  
  //this simply means 80% of screen's width
  const sliderWdith = Dimensions.get('window').width * 0.8;

  return (
    <Slider
      ref={sliderRef}
      width={sliderWdith}
      onSlide={_onSlide}
    />
  )
}
```
**Note:** You can see the Component in action by cloning this
repo and building its test app. Just head over to `testapp`
directory, install the dependencies and run it on Android or IOS.

| onSlideStop  | value  | Called when the thumb or track is released. It passes the current progress as "value".                                                   |

## Known issues
Tapping the Slider on Android will cause it to bounce back and forward
sometimes. I've seen this issue being reported in community as well,
yet I haven't found a certain solution to fix it. It's also not clear to
me that whether it should be fixed at this side or Exoplayer's side.

## TODO list
- [ ] workaround bouncing issue on Android (maybe)
- [ ] add hovering bubble feature
- [ ] add in-code docs
- [x] ~~ensure fabric support~~
- [x] ~~more and better demo gifs~~
- [x] ~~cleanups and refactors~~
- [x] ~~bump test-app dependencies up~~
- [x] ~~write a better example~~
- [x] ~~fix delay between thumb and track while sliding fast~~
- [x] ~~implement tap to seek feature~~
- [x] ~~replace the deprecated `useAnimatedGestureHandler` with newer API~~
- [x] ~~add style prop for root view~~


## Contributions
If you have any idea to improve or fix something, open an issue and state
it in details. You will always be welcomed.

## Compatability
- `react-native-reanimated`: `2.x`, `3.x`
- `react-native-gesture-handler`: `2.x`

## Acknowledgement
The idea behind this is from `react-native-reanimated-slider`.
Since the mentioned module is written with Reanimated v1 API, and hasn't
been updated for a long time, I decided to remake it.
